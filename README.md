## 🛠 How it works

The app uses the gyroscope sensor in your phone to calculate the angular velocity around the z-axis, converting it into RPM (revolutions per minute). It provides:

- Real-time RPM readings
- 10-second measurement mode with automatic result analysis
- Visual feedback and a line chart showing the speed consistency
- Percentage deviation from standard values

All calculations happen **locally on your device** — nothing is stored or sent anywhere.
